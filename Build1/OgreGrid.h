And this grid is 3D-enabled, but limited with min/max, and
not a FrameListener... you can make it a frameListener if you want to!

Ogre Grid by PeterSvP

• This grid have three planes support - XY, XZ, YZ,
• limitations in each dimension (required)
• cell size per dimension
• offset
• colors for offset, master and division axis,
• does NOT depend from the camera used,
• not limited to one instance (NO NAMED items used!)

If you need infinite 2D grid, write code that alters the min and max on the fly,
OR use the Jeroen Dierckx's grid system
